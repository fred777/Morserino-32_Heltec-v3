# Morserino-32_Heltec-v3
Adaption of [Morserino32](https://github.com/oe1wkl/Morserino-32) to [Heltec Wifi32 LoRa v3](https://heltec.org/project/wifi-lora-32-v3/)

I do not need all of the features of the original Morserino-32, so I just did a quick&dirty adaption to be able to use it as a CW trainer with external paddle.
